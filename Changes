Revision history for Gnuplot-Builder

0.10    2014-02-24
        - Add some easy-to-type functions to Gnuplot::Builder. They are exported by default.
        - POD update on Gnuplot::Builder.

0.03    2014-02-24
        - No change to the code.
        - OK, I give up giving all modules the same version number.
          Now only Gnuplot::Builder has the version. Others just don't have any version.

0.02    2014-02-24
        - No change to the code.
        - Now version numbers refer directly to $Gnuplot::Builder::Version::VERSION.
          Using an Exported function seemed to mess up something in CPAN...

0.01    2014-02-23
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
