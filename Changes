Revision history for Gnuplot-Builder

0.13    2014-03-02
        - Project-local update. Fix output of
          Process::MockTool::receive_from_builder().

0.12    2014-03-02
        [BUG FIX]
        - Script plotting methods: if async => 1 and the gnuplot
          process writes large data to STDOUT, the process wouldn't
          finish because it exhausts the write buffer. This is fixed
          now that the output is redirected to the null device if
          async => 1.

0.11    2014-02-24
        - Now Gnuplot::Builder inherits Exporter (instead of importing import()),
          because I want to call export_to_level() on that.

0.10    2014-02-24
        - Add some easy-to-type functions to Gnuplot::Builder. They are exported by default.
        - POD update on Gnuplot::Builder.

0.03    2014-02-24
        - No change to the code.
        - OK, I give up giving all modules the same version number.
          Now only Gnuplot::Builder has the version. Others just don't have any version.

0.02    2014-02-24
        - No change to the code.
        - Now version numbers refer directly to $Gnuplot::Builder::Version::VERSION.
          Using an Exported function seemed to mess up something in CPAN...

0.01    2014-02-23
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
